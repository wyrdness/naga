## Overview

Nagas are semi-divine serpent beings central to Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Depicted with multiple cobra heads (often 5, 7, or more), they possess the ability to shape-shift between serpent and human forms. Nagas dwell in Patala, the underground realm, where they guard vast treasures and water sources.

They are immortal beings with control over weather, water, and magic. Famous nagas include Vasuki (used in the churning of the ocean), Shesha/Ananta (the cosmic serpent upon which Vishnu reclines), and Mucalinda (who protected the Buddha during meditation).

Nagas can be benevolent protectors or malevolent destroyers depending on how they are treated. Their imagery is prominent in temple architecture throughout India and Southeast Asia, particularly at Angkor Wat and Thai temples.
